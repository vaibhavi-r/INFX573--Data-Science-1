###Lab 1: Exploring Car Accidents in relation to Seatbelt Laws in the UK
Datset: seatbelts.csv

Summary:
Seatbelts were not mandatory in the UK before January 31, 1983. This dataset summarizes the road fatalities in the UK from January 1969 through 1984. The aim is to examine trends in road fatalities both before and after the mandatory seatbelt law took effect.


###Lab 2: Exploring Movie ratings from the MovieLens dataset & some Probability Distributions
Dataset: movies.csv, ratings.csv

Summary:
Practice basic EDA on movie ratings and users and examine some common probability distributions(Poisson, Gaussian, Exponential).

###Lab 3: Exploring genres and users in the Movielens dataset
Dataset: movies.csv, ratings.csv

Summary: After developing a good understanding of the movies and ratings, now, the questions are more particular in nature.
What genres of movies are present, and which are most popular? Are there any "super-raters" who rate many more movies than regular folks? What does the rating distribution for the most prolific rater look like by year?
